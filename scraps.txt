Bits of code and writing that aren't used in the application, but which I'm keeping around for sentimental reasons. And just in case they become useful again.

How many countries are there in this dataset, anyway?

That's a lot of countries, and most of them have very few responses. Generalizability is affected if _n_ is too small, so I'm going to somewhat arbitrarily keep the ten countries with the largest sample sizes and drop the rest.

ten_country <- num_country |> slice(1:10)

I'll also replace the [ISO 3166]{.smallcaps} codes with the actual country names.

### Heatmap Limitations in animint2

There are limitations to what heatmaps can do in `animint2`. There is no interactive heatmap akin to an interactive scatterplot. Since this section is auxiliary to the previous section, I've elected to place my demonstration in a `<details>` element:

<details>
<summary>Click Me for the Demonstration</summary>

First, we generate a similar tibble to the one used by our heatmap. The difference is that our heatmap includes the country column and uses it for the count. For example: in `von_count`, there are 5 rows where both personality factors have a sumscore of 10. In `demon_count`, those 5 rows are still there, but they're divided between Australia and the United States:

```{r demon-tbl}
demon_tbl <- sumscores |> 
  select(country, extraversion, conscientiousness) |>
  expand_grid(.name_repair = "minimal")

demon_count <- demon_tbl |> 
  group_by(across(country:conscientiousness)) |>
  count() |> arrange(extraversion)
demon_count
```

Here is our interactive heatmap. The principal problem with it is that it is not actually interactive, no matter what I do:

```{r demon-heatmap}
#| label: demon-heatmap
#| fig-cap: "Nonresponsive heatmap."

demon_discrete <- demon_count |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = conscientiousness,
                       y = extraversion,
                       fill = n)) +
  geom_tile() + coord_fixed()
animint(demon_discrete)
```

The `sample_size` argument lets `fn_lln` know the maximum sample size, while the `sampling` argument lets `fn_lln` know how often `data_vector` should be sampled.

##########

d6 <- sample(x = 1:6, size = 10, replace = TRUE)

data_vector <- d6

population_mean <- data_vector |> mean()

# empty vector
sample_means <- vector(mode = "numeric",
                       length = 10)

# random sampling
for (i in seq_along(data_vector)) {
  sample_means[i] <- data_vector |>
    sample(replace = TRUE)
}

# generate tibble
sample_tbl <- sample_means |> tibble::as_tibble()

[For self-evident reasons, `lln.ani` calls the mean `mu`. As you can tell from my code, I prefer to trade brevity for extreme obviousness. Hence `population_mean`.]{.aside}

### Week 6 (July 3 to July 9)

The goal this week is to figure out why `animint()` won't correctly render interactive density plots, and then to fix it. [My birthday is this week, so I'll probably take that day off and make up the hours elsewhen.]{.aside}

- 6th weekly meeting.
- The error is that `animint()` fails to render the interactive density plots correctly. It also informs me that "`showSelected` does not work with `StatDensity`."

## Hard Test: Testing `fn_lln`

Does `fn_lln` work right? Let's do some unit testing with `testthat` and see.


### Do the Components Work Right?

`fn_lln` is not an especially complex function---it's only about 50 lines of code---

First, let's ensure that the validity check is working right. `fn_lln` needs to accept a vector like `d6` (which is numeric, non-empty, and contains no `NA` values).

```{r test-validity-check}
test_that("accepts numeric non-empty vectors that contain no NA values", {
  expect_no_condition(
    fn_lln(data_vector = d6))
  }
)
```

It also needs to reject vectors that are non-numeric, empty, and contains `NA` values.

```{r test-validity-check-2}
# non-numeric
d24 <- sample(letters, size = 100, replace = TRUE)

# empty
d0 <- vector() |> as.numeric()

# contains NAs
dNA <- c(NA, NA, 1) |> as.numeric()

test_that("throws error message when the data_vector is non-numeric, empty, or contains NA values", {
  expect_error(
    fn_lln(data_vector = d24) ||
      ffn_lln(data_vector = d0) ||
      ffn_lln(data_vector = dNA))
  }
)
```

Both pass. Nice.

Next, we need to ensure that 

Next, we need to ensure that `population_mean` correctly generates the population mean.

```{r tvc-3}
# d1 <- c(1)
# 
# fn_lln(d1)
# 
# test_that("correctly generates population mean", {
#   fn_lln(1)
#   expect_equal(population_mean, 1)
# })

```


### Does it Work Right in General?

Readers are likely most interested in the "Making Changes to the Website" and "See Also" sections. The "Build the Site" section is useful if the website needs to be rebuilt.

[...]

## Making Changes to the Website

The website works, but it's disordered. The site is mostly a mix of the Github README and the official `animint2` documentation on CRAN. It could be better.

##########

<!--
- I deleted the `fortify.r` and `fortify.foo.r` files in the `R/` directory. (Technically the opposite of creation.)
- Then I ran `build.sh` to rebuild the `DESCRIPTION` and got rid of the unnecessary `fortify.foo.Rd` files. It also removed the `borders.Rd` and `map_data.Rd` files.
- Removed `maptools` as a DESCRIPTION suggest.
- Manually removed all links to the deleted files. This involved editing the following 5 files in the `R/` directory, which altered 38 files in the `man/` directory via `build.sh`. Those 5 R files were:
  + `annotation_map.r`
  + `autoplot.r`
  + `plot.r`
  + `layer.r`
  + `geom-map.r`
- Updated the DESCRIPTION from version 2023.3.14 to 2023.6.6
- Updated NEWS by briefly mentioning all the changes I made.
- Made a pull request with the aforementioned changes and linked it to [issue 89](https://github.com/tdhock/animint2/issues/89) on GitHub.

### Debugging

`build.sh` throws up a number of error messages, which can be found in `00check.log`. Two and two of those messages are "Running examples in 'animint2-Ex.R' failed" and "Running the tests in 'tests/testthat.R' failed," respectively.

The reason why the running examples fail seem to be related to the following error message: "Error in `FUN(X[[i]], ...)`: numeric 'envir' arg not of length one." I know this is code from the `ggplot2` side of things. `ripgrep-all` doesn't turn anything up, which suggests that it's not a manually written error message.

One hypothesis is that this is associated with changes that I made. To test this hypothesis, I made a new branch stemming from the unchanged main branch, `89-bug-exam-unaltered-main-branch`. Then I ran `build.sh`. Consistent with this hypothesis, `build.sh` did not output the same errors. Assuming that the hypothesis is correct---that it is my fault---also means the problem is not with `build.sh`.^[It does seem to have problems rendering the PDF, but that's a problem for future me.] So I should stop playing around with it and looking up bash stuff. That's not relevant.

Follow-up hypothesis...
