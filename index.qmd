## About

Some of my notes about and contributions to [the `animint2` R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/animint2/) via the 2023 [Google Summer of Code](https://g.co/gsoc). `animint2` is a fork of `ggplot2` and can be used to generate interactive or animated graphics.

My colleague this year is [Yufan Fei](https://yufanfei.xyz/), who is a much more skilled programmer than I am. [Toby Hocking and Faizan Khan](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2023/wiki/Animated-interactive-ggplots) are our mentors.


## Pages

- [Coding Notebook](notebook.html): My notes on what I've been doing for GSOC so far. Mostly irrelevant unless you wanna see a public record of my coding mistakes and learn what not to do.
- [R Project Examinations](exam/exam.html): Some tests that I took. Mostly irrelevant unless you're interested in seeing some animated graphs of the [five-factor model of personality](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality#Personality_types) or the [weak law of large numbers](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers).
